# Readme

There are three components here:

1) The original C# web application, available at "https://localhost:5001"

2) A Swagger decorated API, located at "https://localhost:5001/swagger"

3) An angular application, located by default at "http://localhost:4200" (requires the dotnet application to be running on port 5001)

The 'fifth' functionality is simply one to retrieve all the films that took place on a particular planet. There is no added functionality to the original .NET views, it's only added to the API and the Angular app, as I figured that was the more pertinent place for it to go.
